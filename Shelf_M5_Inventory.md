| Sodium sulphite 7-hydrate | - | - | |
| Sodium carbonate anhydrous | 1kg | - | |
| Sodium silicate solution | 2.5L | 2006 | EXPIRED SOLUTION |
| Sodium thiosulphate 5H2O | 3kg | - | 2 large containers |

## Safety Information

### Hazard Classifications
- **35-year-old chemicals**: Unknown degradation, potential hazards
- **Expired silicate solution**: May have concentrated/crystallized
- **Unknown compounds from 1990**: IMMEDIATE HAZARD ASSESSMENT NEEDED
- **Sodium thiosulphate**: Generally safe but check for degradation

### Storage Requirements
- **URGENT**: Evaluate all 1990-dated chemicals immediately
- Dispose of expired silicate solution (2006)
- Check thiosulphate for crystal formation
- Isolate unknowns until professional identification

## Inventory Status
- **Total Items**: 10 different chemicals/containers
- **CRITICAL ITEMS**: 2 unknown compounds from 1990, expired solution from 2006
- **Very old chemicals**: 4 items from 1990 (35 years old)
- **Large quantities**: Sodium thiosulphate (3kg), Sodium silicate powder (1kg)

## Emergency Assessment Required
- **IMMEDIATE ACTION**: Professional evaluation of 35-year-old unknowns
- Chemicals from 1990 may have undergone significant degradation
- Expired liquid solutions can become concentrated and dangerous
- Consider entire shelf for hazmat evaluation

## Historical Note
These chemicals represent a significant archive of laboratory materials
requiring careful evaluation before any handling or disposal.
