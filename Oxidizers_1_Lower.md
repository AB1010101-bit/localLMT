## Overview
This section contains additional strong inorganic acids with high hazard levels. These chemicals complement the upper section inventory and are primarily used for analytical chemistry and synthesis work.

## Chemical Inventory

### Strong Inorganic Acids

| Chemical Name | Formula | Quantity | Unit | Hazard Level | Notes |
|---------------|---------|----------|------|--------------|--------|
| Sulphuric Acid | Hâ‚‚SOâ‚„ | 2.5 | L | High | Concentrated sulfuric acid - medium container |
| Nitric Acid | HNOâ‚ƒ | 2.5 | L | High | Bottle 1 of 4 - strong oxidizing acid |
| Nitric Acid | HNOâ‚ƒ | 2.5 | L | High | Bottle 2 of 4 - strong oxidizing acid |
| Nitric Acid | HNOâ‚ƒ | 2.5 | L | High | Bottle 3 of 4 - strong oxidizing acid |
| Nitric Acid | HNOâ‚ƒ | 2.5 | L | High | Bottle 4 of 4 - strong oxidizing acid |

### Phosphoric Acids

| Chemical Name | Formula | Quantity | Unit | Hazard Level | Notes |
|---------------|---------|----------|------|--------------|--------|
| Phosphoric Acid | Hâ‚ƒPOâ‚„ | 1 | bottle | Medium | Standard phosphoric acid |
| Orthophosphoric Acid | Hâ‚ƒPOâ‚„ | 1 | bottle | Medium | Same as phosphoric acid |

## Safety Considerations

### ðŸ”´ High Hazard Chemicals
- **Sulphuric Acid (Hâ‚‚SOâ‚„)**: 
  - Extremely corrosive and dehydrating
  - Generates heat when mixed with water
  - Can cause severe burns and tissue damage
  - Must be added to water, never water to acid

- **Nitric Acid (HNOâ‚ƒ)**: 
  - Strong oxidizing agent and corrosive acid
  - Can ignite organic materials on contact
  - Produces toxic nitrogen oxide vapors
  - Stains skin and clothing yellow
  - Large inventory (10L total) requires special attention

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Hazard Chemicals
- **Phosphoric Acid (Hâ‚ƒPOâ‚„)**: 
  - Less aggressive than mineral acids
  - Still corrosive and can cause burns
  - Used in food industry (safer than other acids)

## Storage Requirements
- Store in cool, dry, well-ventilated area
- Keep nitric acid away from organic materials
- Ensure proper secondary containment
- Separate storage from bases and reducing agents
- Check containers regularly for corrosion
- Maintain inventory logs for large quantities

## Emergency Procedures
- **Nitric Acid Spill**: 
  - Evacuate area if large spill
  - Neutralize with sodium bicarbonate
  - Avoid contact with organic materials
  - Ventilate area to remove nitrogen oxide vapors

- **Sulphuric Acid Spill**:
  - Neutralize slowly with sodium bicarbonate
  - Do not add water directly to concentrated acid
  - Use appropriate absorbent materials

- **Exposure**: 
  - Flush immediately with copious water
  - Remove contaminated clothing
  - Seek immediate medical attention

## Usage Guidelines
- Always work in fume hood
- Wear full PPE (gloves, goggles, lab coat, face shield for large quantities)
- Have neutralizing agents (sodium bicarbonate) readily available
- Use proper dilution techniques (acid to water)
- Monitor for vapor buildup, especially with nitric acid

## Compatibility Notes
- **DO NOT MIX** nitric acid with organic solvents
- Keep nitric acid separate from alcohols and other reducing agents
- Store acids away from cyanides and sulfides
- Ensure proper ventilation for all acid storage

## Total Count: 7 Chemicals
- 5 Strong mineral acids (all high hazard)
- 2 Phosphoric acids (medium hazard)
- **Total Volume**: 12.5L of high-hazard acids
