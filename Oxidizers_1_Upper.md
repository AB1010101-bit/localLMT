## Location: Oxidizers Cabinet 1 - Upper Shelf

## Overview
This section contains strong inorganic acids and phosphorus compounds with high to extreme hazard levels. These chemicals are primarily used for analytical chemistry, organic synthesis, and laboratory preparations.

## Chemical Inventory

### Strong Acids

| Chemical Name | Formula | Quantity | Unit | Hazard Level | Notes |
|---------------|---------|----------|------|--------------|--------|
| Ethanoic Acid | CH‚ÇÉCOOH | 1 | bottle | Medium | Acetic acid - common organic acid |
| Hydrochloric Acid | HCl | 5 | L | High | Large container - strong mineral acid |
| Hydrochloric Acid | HCl | 2.5 | L | High | Medium container - strong mineral acid |
| Sulphuric Acid | H‚ÇÇSO‚ÇÑ | 1 | L | High | Concentrated sulfuric acid |

### Phosphorus Compounds

| Chemical Name | Formula | Quantity | Unit | Hazard Level | Notes |
|---------------|---------|----------|------|--------------|--------|
| Metaphosphoric Acid Powder | HPO‚ÇÉ | 1 | container | Medium | Powder form - dehydrating agent |
| Phosphorus Pentaoxide | P‚ÇÇO‚ÇÖ | 2 | containers | Extreme | Highly reactive - strong dehydrating agent |
| Phosphorus Pentachloride | PCl‚ÇÖ | 4 | bottles | Extreme | Chlorinating agent - moisture sensitive |

### Unidentified Materials

| Chemical Name | Formula | Quantity | Unit | Hazard Level | Notes |
|---------------|---------|----------|------|--------------|--------|
| Unidentified Chemical | Unknown | 3 | bottles | High | Requires identification and classification |

## Safety Considerations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Extreme Hazard Chemicals
- **Phosphorus Pentaoxide (P‚ÇÇO‚ÇÖ)**: Extremely reactive with water, causes severe burns
- **Phosphorus Pentachloride (PCl‚ÇÖ)**: Releases HCl gas in moist air, highly corrosive

### üî¥ High Hazard Chemicals
- **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)**: Corrosive, causes severe burns, releases dangerous vapors
- **Sulphuric Acid (H‚ÇÇSO‚ÇÑ)**: Extremely corrosive, dehydrating agent, exothermic with water
- **Unidentified Chemicals**: Treat as high hazard until properly identified

### üü° Medium Hazard Chemicals
- **Ethanoic Acid**: Corrosive, flammable, strong odor
- **Metaphosphoric Acid**: Corrosive, hygroscopic

## Storage Requirements
- Store in cool, dry, well-ventilated area
- Keep acids separated from bases and metals
- Phosphorus compounds must be kept dry
- Secondary containment recommended for all liquid acids
- Ensure proper labeling and inventory tracking

## Emergency Procedures
- **Spill**: Neutralize acids with sodium bicarbonate, absorb phosphorus compounds with dry sand
- **Exposure**: Flush with copious amounts of water, seek immediate medical attention
- **Fire**: Use appropriate fire extinguisher (not water for phosphorus compounds)

## Usage Guidelines
- Always use in fume hood
- Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, goggles, lab coat)
- Have neutralizing agents readily available
- Follow institutional chemical hygiene plan

## Total Count: 8 Chemicals
- 4 Strong acids (1 medium, 3 high hazard)
- 3 Phosphorus compounds (1 medium, 2 extreme hazard)
- 1 Unidentified material (high hazard)
