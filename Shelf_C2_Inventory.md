## Safety Information

### Hazard Classifications
- **Iron (III) chloride**: Corrosive, causes burns
- **Iron compounds**: Generally low toxicity but can cause irritation
- **Ferrous sulphide**: May release toxic hydrogen sulfide gas when wet
- **Iron metal fillings**: Fire hazard when finely divided

### Storage Requirements
- Store iron chlorides in dry conditions to prevent hydrolysis
- Keep ferrous sulphide away from acids and moisture
- Store iron metal fillings away from ignition sources
- Ensure good ventilation for all iron compounds
- Dispose of expired iron (III) chloride safely

## Inventory Status
- **Total Items**: 13 different chemicals/containers
- **Items requiring attention**: Iron (III) chloride 6-water (expired)
- **High-risk chemicals**: Ferrous sulphide, Iron (III) chloride
- **Multiple containers**: Iron metal fillings (3), Iron (III) oxide (2), Iron (II) sulphate (4)

## Special Notes
- Multiple forms of iron oxides available for different applications
- Large quantities of iron compounds suggest metallurgy/analytical work
- Ferrous sulphide requires special handling due to gas evolution risk
- High iron content materials useful for redox experiments
