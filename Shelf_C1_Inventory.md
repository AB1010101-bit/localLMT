## Safety Information

### Hazard Classifications
- **Chromium compounds**: Potential carcinogens, handle with care
- **Cobalt compounds**: Toxic, potential allergen
- **Copper compounds**: Irritant, some toxic if ingested
- **Chlorine water**: Corrosive, oxidizer (EXPIRED - dispose safely)
- **Iodine**: Toxic, corrosive, staining

### Storage Requirements
- Store chromium compounds in designated area with proper ventilation
- Keep cobalt compounds away from food/drink areas
- Store copper compounds in dry conditions
- Dispose of expired chlorine water and ferric chloride safely
- Keep iodine in dark, well-ventilated area

## Inventory Status
- **Total Items**: 39 different chemicals/containers
- **Items requiring attention**: Chlorine water (expired), Ferric chloride (expired)
- **High-risk chemicals**: All chromium compounds, cobalt compounds
- **Multiple containers**: Many copper compounds have multiple containers

## Special Notes
- High concentration of copper compounds suggests analytical/electrochemistry use
- Expired chemicals need immediate attention for safe disposal
- Multiple forms of copper compounds available (metal, oxides, salts)
