## Safety Information

### Hazard Classifications
- **Sodium chlorate**: Strong oxidizer, fire/explosion risk
- **Sodium bismuthate**: Oxidizer, potentially toxic
- **Soda lime**: Caustic, causes burns
- **Most sodium salts**: Generally low toxicity but hygroscopic

### Storage Requirements
- Keep sodium chlorate away from combustible materials
- Store soda lime in dry conditions
- Ensure good ventilation for all compounds
- Check older chemicals for degradation signs

## Inventory Status
- **Total Items**: 11 different chemicals/containers
- **Items requiring attention**: All items need age assessment
- **High-risk chemicals**: Sodium chlorate, Sodium bismuthate
- **Multiple containers**: Sodium acetate (4), Sodium bromide (4)

## Special Notes
- Old chemical shelf - evaluate all for continued use
- Multiple containers suggest these were frequently used
- Sodium chlorate requires special oxidizer storage protocols
