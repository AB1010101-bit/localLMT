- Dilute carefully with water while stirring
- Neutralize with sodium bicarbonate to pH 6-8
- Concentrated acid requires hazardous waste disposal

Sulfuric Acid (H‚ÇÇSO‚ÇÑ)
- EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS - never add water to concentrated acid
- Add acid to ice water slowly while stirring
- Neutralize with sodium bicarbonate to pH 6-8
- Generates heat during dilution - use caution

Nitric Acid (HNO‚ÇÉ)
- Strong oxidizer - handle with extreme care
- Dilute carefully, neutralize with sodium bicarbonate
- Do not mix with organics during neutralization
- Dispose through hazardous waste contractor
```

#### Halogenated Solvents
```
Dichloromethane (CH‚ÇÇCl‚ÇÇ)
- NEVER pour down drain or evaporate in lab
- Collect in labeled waste container
- Do not mix with other solvents
- Dispose through licensed waste contractor only
```

#### Heavy Metal Compounds
```
Copper Sulphate (CuSO‚ÇÑ¬∑5H‚ÇÇO)
- TOXIC TO AQUATIC LIFE
- Never pour down drain or into environment
- Collect for hazardous waste disposal
- Can be precipitated and sent to metal recovery

Barium Chloride (BaCl‚ÇÇ)
- Highly toxic - collect for hazardous waste
- Forms toxic compounds with sulfates
- Never dispose down drain
- Requires specialized disposal
```

#### Strong Oxidizers
```
Potassium Permanganate (KMnO‚ÇÑ)
- Reduce with sodium bisulfite until colorless
- Never mix with organic materials
- Neutralize reduced solution before disposal
- Collect concentrated solutions for hazardous waste

Phosphorus Pentoxide (P‚ÇÇO‚ÇÖ)
- Add slowly to large amount of ice water in fume hood
- Allow complete reaction to form phosphoric acid
- Neutralize resulting acid with sodium bicarbonate
- Never add water directly to P‚ÇÇO‚ÇÖ
```

### üü° Moderate Risk Chemicals

#### pH Indicators
```
Phenolphthalein
- Collect waste solutions for proper disposal
- Do not flush concentrated form down drain
- Can be neutralized before disposal

Methyl Orange/Methyl Red
- Azo dye compounds - collect for hazardous waste
- Do not pour down drain
- Treat as organic waste

Bromothymol Blue
- Dilute solutions can be flushed with copious water
- Concentrated solutions require hazardous waste disposal
```

#### Organic Solvents
```
Ethyl Acetate
- Flammable - collect in labeled waste container
- Small amounts can evaporate in fume hood
- Do not pour down drain
- Dispose through organic waste program

Ethanol
- Flammable - small amounts can be evaporated
- Can be diluted and disposed down drain in small quantities
- Large quantities require solvent waste disposal
```

### üü¢ Lower Risk Chemicals

#### Common Salts
```
Sodium Chloride (NaCl)
- Generally safe for drain disposal with water
- Large quantities should be dissolved first
- Food-grade safe, analytical grade check for contamination

Calcium Carbonate (CaCO‚ÇÉ)
- Environmentally safe - can go in trash or compost
- Can be neutralized with mild acid and flushed
- Regular trash unless contaminated

Magnesium Sulphate (MgSO‚ÇÑ¬∑7H‚ÇÇO)
- Safe for drain disposal when dissolved
- Can be used in garden as fertilizer if pure
- Dilute large amounts before disposal
```

#### Weak Acids/Bases
```
Acetic Acid (CH‚ÇÉCOOH)
- Dilute solutions can be neutralized and flushed
- Concentrated acid should be diluted first
- Neutralize to pH 6-8 before disposal

Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHCO‚ÇÉ)
- Environmentally safe - can be flushed with water
- Can be composted or disposed in regular trash
- Food grade completely safe
```
