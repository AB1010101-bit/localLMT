## Safety Information

### Hazard Classifications
- **Calcium metal**: Highly reactive with water, flammable
- **Calcium chloride**: Hygroscopic, irritant to skin/eyes
- **Calcium hydroxide**: Caustic, causes burns
- **Calcium hydride**: Reacts violently with water, flammable gas evolution
- **Calcium fluoride**: Toxic if ingested

### Storage Requirements
- Keep calcium metal under inert atmosphere or dry conditions
- Store calcium hydride away from moisture
- Keep caustic compounds (hydroxide) in secure, dry location
- Ensure good ventilation for reactive compounds
- Store expired chemicals separately for disposal

## Inventory Status
- **Total Items**: 22 different chemicals/containers
- **Items requiring attention**: Calcium carbonate (unilab) - expired 1999
- **High-risk chemicals**: Calcium metal, Calcium hydride, Calcium hydroxide
- **Multiple containers**: Calcium chloride anhydrous (7), Calcium nitrate-4-Water (3)

## Special Notes
- Calcium metal granules require special handling - keep dry
- Expired calcium carbonate should be evaluated for disposal
- Multiple containers suggest high usage of calcium chloride
