## Emergency Procedures

### Aniline Exposure
1. **Skin Contact**: 
   - Remove contaminated clothing immediately
   - Wash with soap and water for 15+ minutes
   - Seek immediate medical attention
   - Monitor for methemoglobinemia

2. **Inhalation**: 
   - Move to fresh air immediately
   - Give oxygen if available
   - Call emergency medical services
   - Monitor breathing and consciousness

### Methanol Exposure
1. **Ingestion**: 
   - **DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING**
   - Give ethanol immediately if available (vodka, etc.)
   - Call poison control immediately
   - Transport to hospital with antidote capability

2. **Inhalation/Skin**: 
   - Fresh air, wash skin
   - Seek medical evaluation for any exposure

## Usage Guidelines

### Mandatory Protocols for High-Hazard Materials
- Pre-approval required for aniline use
- Buddy system for methanol work
- Emergency contact numbers posted
- Antidote availability confirmed
- Medical surveillance program

### General Guidelines
- Always work in fume hood for volatiles
- Double-check chemical identity before use
- Have emergency procedures immediately available
- Regular inventory and inspection
- Proper waste disposal protocols

## Total Count: 29 Chemicals
