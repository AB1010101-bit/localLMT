## Safety Information

### Hazard Classifications
- **Barium compounds**: Toxic, potential cardiac effects
- **Barium chromate**: Carcinogen, very toxic
- **Barium peroxide**: Oxidizer, may cause fire
- **Cadmium Oxide**: Highly toxic, carcinogen
- **Bismuth compounds**: Generally low toxicity

### Storage Requirements
- Store barium compounds in secure, dry location
- Keep barium chromate in designated carcinogen storage
- Separate oxidizers from combustible materials
- Handle cadmium oxide with extreme care - use fume hood
- Ensure proper labeling of all containers

## Inventory Status
- **Total Items**: 20 different chemicals/containers
- **Items requiring attention**: 1 unidentified compound
- **High-risk chemicals**: Barium chromate, Cadmium oxide
- **Duplicate entries**: Barium carbonate (one with 2003 batch date)

## Special Notes
- Multiple containers of barium nitrate suggest high usage
- Cadmium oxide requires special disposal procedures
- Unidentified compound needs immediate identification
