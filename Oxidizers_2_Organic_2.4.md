## Chemical Properties & Applications

### High-Hazard Reagents

#### Acetic Anhydride (5L total)
- **Uses**: Acetylation reactions, synthesis of aspirin, cellulose acetate
- **Properties**: Highly reactive with water, forms acetic acid
- **Industrial Applications**: Pharmaceutical synthesis, polymer production

#### Dichloromethane
- **Uses**: Extraction solvent, paint stripper, degreasing agent
- **Properties**: Volatile, dense, good solvent for organics
- **Concerns**: Suspected carcinogen, ozone-depleting substance

#### Formic Acid
- **Uses**: Leather tanning, textile processing, reducing agent
- **Properties**: Simplest carboxylic acid, reducing properties
- **Biological**: Found in ant venom, bee stings

#### Ethylene Glycol
- **Uses**: Antifreeze, coolant, polymer synthesis
- **Properties**: Viscous, sweet taste (dangerous), hygroscopic
- **Toxicity**: Metabolized to toxic glycolic and oxalic acids

### Medium-Hazard Compounds

#### Specialized Alcohols
- **3-Methylbutan-1-ol**: Branched alcohol for specialized synthesis
- **Amyl Alcohol**: Solvent for fats, oils, and waxes

#### Phthalate Ester
- **Di-n-butyl Phthalate**: Plasticizer, potential endocrine disruptor

## Critical Safety Considerations

### üö® EXTREME CAUTION REQUIRED

#### Acetic Anhydride (5L total)
- **Hazards**:
  - Violently reactive with water
  - Severe burns to skin and eyes
  - Corrosive vapors damage respiratory system
  - Large quantity increases risk
- **Special Requirements**:
  - Store in cool, dry location
  - Never add water directly
  - Use only in fume hood
  - Have neutralizing agents available
  - Secondary containment mandatory

#### Dichloromethane
- **Health Risks**:
  - Suspected human carcinogen (Group 2A)
  - CNS depressant at high concentrations
  - Metabolized to carbon monoxide
  - High vapor pressure - inhalation risk
- **Special Requirements**:
  - Use only in fume hood
  - Minimize skin contact
  - Monitor for vapor accumulation
  - Special disposal requirements

#### Ethylene Glycol
- **Acute Toxicity**:
  - Sweet taste makes accidental ingestion likely
  - As little as 30ml can be fatal
  - Delayed symptoms (appears like intoxication initially)
  - Causes kidney failure and brain damage
- **Emergency Treatment**:
  - Antidotes: Ethanol or fomepizole
  - Hemodialysis may be required
  - Time-critical treatment

### üî¥ High Hazard Protocols

#### Formic Acid
- **Corrosive Properties**: Causes severe burns
- **Reducing Agent**: Can react with oxidizers
- **Storage**: Away from strong oxidizers and bases

## Storage Requirements

### Segregation Protocols
1. **Acetic Anhydride**: Separate dry storage, away from water sources
2. **Dichloromethane**: Cool storage, away from heat and light
3. **Ethylene Glycol**: Clearly labeled "POISON", away from food areas
4. **Organic Acids**: Separate from bases and metals
5. **Phthalates**: Environmental storage considerations

### Secondary Containment
- All liquid containers require secondary containment
- Acetic anhydride requires specialized dry containment
- Regular inspection for container integrity

## Emergency Procedures

### Acetic Anhydride Incident
1. **Spill Response**:
   - Evacuate area if large spill
   - Do not add water directly
   - Use dry sand or vermiculite for absorption
   - Neutralize slowly with sodium bicarbonate
   - Ensure adequate ventilation

2. **Exposure Response**:
   - Skin: Flush with water immediately for 15+ minutes
   - Eyes: Flush with water, seek immediate medical attention
   - Inhalation: Fresh air, seek medical evaluation

### Dichloromethane Exposure
1. **Inhalation**: Fresh air, monitor for CNS effects
2. **Skin Contact**: Remove contaminated clothing, wash thoroughly
3. **Chronic Exposure**: Medical surveillance recommended

### Ethylene Glycol Poisoning
1. **Suspected Ingestion**:
   - Call poison control immediately
   - Do not induce vomiting
   - Give ethanol if available and instructed
   - Transport to hospital with antidote capability
   - Time is critical for treatment

## Usage Guidelines

### Mandatory Protocols
- Pre-approval required for acetic anhydride use
- Fume hood mandatory for dichloromethane
- Never use ethylene glycol where food/drink might be present
- Emergency contact numbers readily available
- Antidote protocols posted

### Personal Protective Equipment
- Chemical-resistant gloves (nitrile for most applications)
- Safety glasses with side shields
- Lab coat or chemical-resistant apron
- Face shield for acetic anhydride work
- Respiratory protection if ventilation inadequate

## Environmental Considerations
- **Dichloromethane**: Ozone-depleting substance - minimize use
- **Phthalates**: Endocrine disruptors - proper disposal essential
- **All chemicals**: Follow institutional waste disposal protocols

## Total Count: 12 Chemicals
- 5 High-hazard compounds requiring special protocols
- 7 Medium-hazard compounds with standard precautions
- **Critical Materials**: 5L acetic anhydride, dichloromethane, ethylene glycol
